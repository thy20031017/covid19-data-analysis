# RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS APPROACHES AND VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

## FOR UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN COVID-19 TESTING DATASET

### RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS APPROACHES

#### 1. TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
- **Rolling Averages**: Calculate 7-day rolling averages for positive cases and testing volumes to smooth daily fluctuations and identify trends
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Analyze if there are weekly or monthly patterns in testing and positivity rates
- **Rate of Change**: Calculate daily and weekly percentage changes in cases to identify acceleration/deceleration
- **Cumulative Analysis**: Track cumulative tests, cases, and positivity rates over time

#### 2. COMPARATIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
- **Group Comparisons**: Perform t-tests or chi-square tests to determine if differences in positivity rates between groups are statistically significant
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between testing volumes and positive cases
- **Risk Ratio Calculation**: Calculate relative risk of positive tests across different demographic and residence groups
- **Variance Analysis**: Compare volatility in case numbers between different groups

#### 3. DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
- **Frequency Distributions**: Analyze how daily test counts and positive cases are distributed
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify days with unusually high or low values that may indicate testing strategy changes
- **Normality Tests**: Determine if data follows normal distribution for appropriate statistical tests

#### 4. SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
- **Cross-Group Analysis**: Examine interactions between demographic groups and residence types
- **Time-Segmented Analysis**: Compare different periods (semesters, pre/post interventions)
- **Cohort Analysis**: Track specific groups over time if data allows

#### 5. FORECASTING (IF APPLICABLE)
- **Simple Trend Projection**: Project short-term trends based on recent data
- **Moving Average Models**: Use time series forecasting models to predict near-term values

### RECOMMENDED VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

#### 1. TEMPORAL VISUALIZATIONS
- **Line Charts**: Primary visualization for time series data showing:
  * Daily/weekly positivity rates
  * Testing volumes over time
  * Positive case counts with trendlines
  * Rolling averages (7-day, 14-day)
- **Area Charts**: Show cumulative cases/tests over time with stacked areas for different groups
- **Heat Maps**: Calendar heat maps showing daily positivity rates or test counts
- **Bar Charts**: Weekly/monthly aggregated data for easier comparison

#### 2. COMPARATIVE VISUALIZATIONS
- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Compare testing volumes and positive cases across different demographic/residence groups
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Show composition of tests/cases by group over time
- **Side-by-Side Box Plots**: Compare distributions of positivity rates between groups
- **Violin Plots**: Show distribution of test counts across different categories

#### 3. RELATIONSHIP VISUALIZATIONS
- **Scatter Plots**: Plot positive cases vs. testing volume to identify correlation
- **Bubble Charts**: Scatter plots with bubble size representing another variable (e.g., time)
- **Correlation Matrices**: Visualize relationships between multiple variables

#### 4. GEOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS (IF LOCATION DATA WERE AVAILABLE)
- **Choropleth Maps**: Color-coded maps showing positivity rates by area
- **Point Maps**: Plot locations of testing sites or clusters

#### 5. DASHBOARD ELEMENTS
- **Summary Cards**: Key metrics (total tests, cases, positivity rate)
- **Progress Indicators**: Compare current vs. previous periods
- **Filtered Views**: Interactive filters for different groups, time periods

### SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS DATASET

#### TOP PRIORITY VISUALIZATIONS
1. **Time Series Line Chart**: 7-day rolling positivity rate for the entire university, with separate lines for Students vs. Faculty/Staff
2. **Stacked Area Chart**: Cumulative positive cases by student residence type
3. **Grouped Bar Chart**: Average weekly testing volumes by group (Faculty/Staff vs. Students)
4. **Heat Map Calendar**: Daily positivity rates colored by intensity
5. **Box Plot**: Distribution of daily positivity rates across different groups

#### ADVANCED ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
1. **Event Analysis**: Identify significant changes in positivity rates and correlate with university events/policies
2. **Testing Efficiency Analysis**: Examine how the ratio of tests to positive cases changes over time
3. **Peak Detection**: Statistical methods to identify significant peaks in cases
4. **Testing Coverage Analysis**: Estimate percentage of population tested based on available data

### IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for analysis and visualization
- **R**: Tidyverse, ggplot2 for statistical analysis and visualization
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and advanced visualizations
- **Excel**: For basic analysis and charting if preferred

These approaches and visualizations will help you systematically explore the dataset, identify meaningful patterns, and communicate insights effectively about the COVID-19 testing program at the University of Michigan during this one-year period.
